<p>
streamlit-option-menu is a simple Streamlit component that allows users to select a single item from a list of options in a menu. It is similar in function to st.selectbox(), except that:

It uses a simple static list to display the options instead of a dropdown
It has configurable icons for each option item and the menu title
